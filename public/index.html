    <h1>Why Education Matters</h1>
    <p>Education is more than just learning—it’s a powerful pathway to opportunity. In neighborhoods affected by poverty, where
      resources are often limited and futures uncertain, access to quality education can be life-changing.</p>
    <p>It empowers children and teens with the tools to understand the world, to shape their futures, and to break generational
      cycles of hardship. Without fair access to education, countless young minds full of potential are overlooked.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to amplify awareness and drive action. When we uplift education in these communities, we’re not just investing
      in individuals—we’re investing in stronger families, empowered neighborhoods, and a more just society.</p>
